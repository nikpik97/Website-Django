## General info
This project meant to serve as an introductory expereince in full-stack web development. I'm going to be experimenting with different technologies such as django, react-native, etc. In addition, this project will (hopefully) end up being a professional-looking website with an about-me/resume section, portfolio, blog, and whatever else I see fit.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
*  Raspberry Pi
*  Python 3.6
*  Apache Web Server
*  Django
